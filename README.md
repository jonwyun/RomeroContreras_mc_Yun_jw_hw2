# Angry Dog Donuts: A Delightful Web Experience

Welcome to the repository of Angry Dog Donuts, a captivating web project inspired by a fictional donut cafe nestled in the serene streets of Osaka, Japan. This project is not just about donuts; it's a showcase of modern web development techniques, responsive design, and the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

Angry Dog Donuts offers users the delightful experience of customizing their donuts by selecting from our secret dough recipes and a variety of spring season toppings, including persimmon and peach icing. The website is designed to be engaging and interactive, allowing users to see their custom donut come to life as they make their selections.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Utilizing OOP principles in JavaScript, we've created custom classes (`Dough`, `Topping`, `Donut`) to dynamically generate content based on user selections. This approach not only makes the code more organized and maintainable but also enhances the user experience by providing immediate visual feedback.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. This responsiveness is achieved through meticulous CSS/SASS design, with media queries ensuring that the layout, typography, and images look great from mobile to desktop screens.

- **Efficient Code Bundling**: To ensure that the website loads quickly and runs smoothly, we've employed Parcel.js for bundling. This tool helps in minifying the code and optimizing asset loading, which is crucial for maintaining a fast and efficient website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & SASS**: For structuring and styling the website, providing a solid foundation for the responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic content generation and interactive features, following OOP principles.
- **Parcel.js**: For code bundling, minification, and optimization.
- **Git**: For version control, showcasing best practices in code management and collaboration.
